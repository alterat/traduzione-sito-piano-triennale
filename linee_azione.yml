    The MEF, in agreement with the Revenue Agency, AgID, the Regions and ANCI, will issue the transposition measures of the 2014/55/​EU European Electronic Billing Directive, which will result in adapting the systems that allow for the issuance and receipt of electronic invoices in European format.
    The Administrations will evolve their systems to allow for the electronic invoicing to integrate with the accounting processes and accounting cycle automation in accordance with the technical rules for data sessions and interoperability between systems of e-procurement issued by AgID.

- all the SIOPE+ infrastructural and application components to be developed on the Bank of Italy and the MEF platforms will be available; 
- a pilot group of banks and institutions will be involved, identified in consultation with the stakeholder associations, which will have to carry out the procedural changes necessary for the launch of the pilot phase.
    In July 2017, the pilot phase will start.
    From January 2018, the scope of the new project will be expanded, reinforcing - if necessary - the infrastructure components in order to properly manage the new volumes. In particular, the IT components required for the extension of determining revenue and central PA operations will be finalised.
    The Administrations are responsible for adopting systems to join the SIOPE+ in accordance with the plan defined by the General State Accounting, in agreement with the Bank of Italy and AgID and the local PA representatives.
    The Administrations can participate by adopting their own systems or those offered by the General State Accounting in a subsidiary logic or, alternatively, by using the services provided by other intermediaries.
